# Fullstack APP

## Project Overview

This project is a full stack monolith built using **Nuxt.js** on the frontend and **Laravel** on the backend, with **Apollo GraphQL** for data fetching and **Laravel Lighthouse** handling GraphQL on the server. The state management is handled by **Pinia**, and **Sanctum** provides secure authentication.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - PHP dependency manager
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or another local server environment
- [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/) or a compatible version
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional)
- [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional)

### Backend (Laravel + Lighthouse)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maktezi/APP.git
    cd APP
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. Copy the example environment file and set up environment variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. Set up the database configuration in the `.env` file and run migration and seeders:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

5. Install Laravel Lighthouse for GraphQL:

    ```bash
    composer require nuwave/lighthouse
    ```

### Frontend (Nuxt.js)

1. Install the frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Start the Nuxt.js development server and Laravel server:

    ```bash
    bun start
    ```

## Authentication

This application uses **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication. To authenticate a user, make a POST request to `/api/login` with the necessary credentials, and use the generated token for authenticated API requests.

## GraphQL API

GraphQL queries and mutations are handled by **Laravel Lighthouse**. You can explore and test the GraphQL API through the GraphQL Playground available at:
```bash
http://localhost:8000/graphiql
```

## Generating GraphQL Types

To generate the GraphQL types, run the following command:

```bash
bun codegen
```

## Clear backend cache

This will clear all the cache files in the backend.

```bash
bun clear
```
